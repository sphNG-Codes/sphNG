c--For Hirashita & Yan 2009 type dust coagulation:
c      HY09bin_rho stores the dust grain mass distribution for each
c      SPH particle (must be multiplied by rho() to get the actual
c      grain mass density for that SPH particle).  See Bate (2022).
c      HY09cen: stores the dust grain mass distribution at the centre
c      of the SPH domain, and HY09cen_totaldens gives the total
c      mass fraction of the dust compared to the gas mass for that
c      central particle (e.g. 0.01 for a dust-to-gas ratio of 1:100).
c      These central values form part of the ASCII output.
