Use ./maketables followed by ./invert to create the essential equation 
of state tables for using RT in sphNG.

To compile these you need to compile "like" (depending on your options):

ifort -O3 -mcmodel=medium -WB -warn nousage -warn uninitialized -warn unused -warn truncated_source -warn interfaces -nogen-interfaces -convert big_endian -r8 -o maketables maketables.f specificheat.f

ifort -O3 -mcmodel=medium -WB -warn nousage -warn uninitialized -warn unused -warn truncated_source -warn interfaces -nogen-interfaces -convert big_endian -r8 -o invert invert.f specificheat.f ../getcv.f


The 'maketables' program creates 'specheattbl'.  This table used 
to be used directly.  
However, it was subsequently replaced by 'gasttbl' and 'utbl'.  These 
are created from 'specheattbl' by the invert.f programme.
The 'gasttbl' gives the ratio of u/T (using the sphNG routine getcv.f).  
The 'utbl' is used to get the value of specific internal energy, 'u' 
from a given temperature (using the sphNG routine uset.f).

At the same time, the invert.f routine creates the 'molmasstbl' table
which holds the inverse of the molecular mass (i.e. 1/mu).  This used
to be done by the program 'molecmass.f', but in July 2014 the invert.f
program was modified to do both (to avoid having two versions of the
"same" code. The program 'molecmass.f' is now depreciated, and has
been removed from the repository (version -r1670).

In June 2014, MRB extended the density range covered by the tables.
Prior to this the density in g/cm^3 ranged from log10(rho) = -20 to +3.
After this, the density in g/cm^3 ranged from log10(rho) = -30 to +3.
The extension was necessary to include low-density interstellar medium 
physics.  The new tables were called:

molmasstbl_lowdens
gasttbl_lowdens
utbl_lowdens

so older versions of the code could still use the earlier tables.

At the same time, the table definitions and dimensions were all moved 
into a single sphNG COMMONS/eostbl, which replaced the earlier:

COMMONS/utbl
COMMONS/tgtbl
COMMONS/mutbl

Notes about these tables
------------------------

22/09/2010 - Ben Ayliffe

We noticed a strange discontinuity in the tables at log(rho) = -2. This
has been found to be the result of a switch in specificheat.f which has
been commented out and labelled. Essentially the degree of dissociation
of H2 was being calculated by two different equations either side of
this point, and they did not match at the interface for a range of
energies around log(u) = 12. We have now extended the use of the equation
previously employed only for log(rho) < -2 to the higher density regime.

There were also two different ways of setting ltg1 & ltg2 in invert.f.
Both can be seen in invert.old. I think that the N-1, N option was
introduced by me for some or other reason, but for the sake of
consistency with previous tables and calculations that use those tables,
and because it makes bugger all difference, we will stick with using N,
and N+1.




Other routines in this directory
--------------------------------

22/09/2010 - Ben Ayliffe

There are a few routines in this directory that you are unlikely to need.

testmuandcv.f - Stuart's tool for testing the heat capacity tables.
testkappa.f - Stuart's tool for testing the opacity tables.
converttoascii.f - My tool to output the tables in ascii format so you
		   can plot them, i.e. in IDL.


Tables in this directory
------------------------

22/09/2010 - Ben Ayliffe

The only pre-made table included in this directory is gaptbl. This is only
used for models which involve a planet in a disc section using the injection
boundary derived from previous isothermal global models. The code used to
produce the table is not included in the repository because it relies on HDF
dump files from the isothermal global model, which are too large to include
here. It has been packaged into an archive which should be obtainable from
me, or once I have disappeared, from Matthew Bate.
