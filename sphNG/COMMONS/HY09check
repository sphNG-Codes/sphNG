c--For Hirashita & Yan 2009 type dust coagulation:
c      Store an estimate of how far a grain at the peak of the grain
c      mass distribution may have drifted in terms of the fraction of
c      the local smoothing length.
c      HY09peak stores the grain size that corresponds to the peak of
c      the grain mass distribution for each SPH particle.
