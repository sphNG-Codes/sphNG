Use ./maketables to create the two essential tables for using RT in sphNG;
these are molmasstbl, and gasttbl.

This routine also creates utbl, which can be used with routine uset.f to
obtain the internal energy that matches a given temperature.

If you wish to avoid recompiling for some reason, just run these routines:

run: ./specheat
run: ./goinvert
run: ./gomass

Notes about these tables
------------------------

22/09/2010 - Ben Ayliffe

We noticed a strange discontinuity in the tables at log(rho) = -2. This
has been found to be the result of a switch in specificheat.f which has
been commented out and labelled. Essentially the degree of dissociation
of H2 was being calculated by two different equations either side of
this point, and they did not match at the interface for a range of
energies around log(u) = 12. We have now extended the use of the equation
previously employed only for log(rho) < -2 to the higher density regime.

There were also two different ways of setting ltg1 & ltg2 in invert.f.
Both can be seen in invert.old. I think that the N-1, N option was
introduced by me for some or other reason, but for the sake of
consistency with previous tables and calculations that use those tables,
and because it makes bugger all difference, we will stick with using N,
and N+1.




Other routines in this directory
--------------------------------

22/09/2010 - Ben Ayliffe

There are a few routines in this directory that you are unlikely to need.

testmuandcv.f - Stuart's tool for testing the heat capacity tables.
testkappa.f - Stuart's tool for testing the opacity tables.
converttoascii.f - My tool to output the tables in ascii format so you
		   can plot them, i.e. in IDL.


Tables in this directory
------------------------

22/09/2010 - Ben Ayliffe

The only pre-made table included in this directory is gaptbl. This is only
used for models which involve a planet in a disc section using the injection
boundary derived from previous isothermal global models. The code used to
produce the table is not included in the repository because it relies on HDF
dump files from the isothermal global model, which are too large to include
here. It has been packaged into an archive which should be obtainable from
me, or once I have disappeared, from Matthew Bate.
